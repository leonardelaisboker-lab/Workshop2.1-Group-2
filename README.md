## MRAC01 (25/26): Workshop 2.1 – Robotic Coin Toss
This project is developed within the framework of MRAC Workshop 2.1: Team Collaborative Workflow and Modular System Development. The aim of the workshop is to learn, internalize, and apply collaborative software development practices using Git and GitHub while building a modular robotic system. The assigned task of this group is the design and implementation of a robotic coin toss using a robotic arm and a standard 2-euro coin, with a focus on system engineering, documentation, and reproducibility.

## Overview
Although a coin toss is a simple human action, translating it into a robotic task reveals a complex system involving mechanics, kinematics, control logic, sensing, and repeatability. The project starts with an analysis of the human coin-toss motion, where the coin is balanced on the index finger at a slight inclination. The rotational motion is generated by elastic energy stored in the thumb and finger muscles, which is released to create vertical lift, forward impulse, and rotation. To maintain a mostly vertical trajectory, the release plane is subtly angled toward the body. Based on this analysis, several mechanical abstractions were explored, such as piston-based impulse systems and motor-driven ramp mechanisms. The project ultimately focuses on executing the task directly with a robotic arm, aligning with the workshop’s emphasis on robotic control, modular system design, and integration. A central question of the project is whether the system should prioritize randomness, as in a traditional coin toss, or controlled repeatability, which is intrinsic to robotic systems.
