## MRAC01 (25/26): Workshop 2.1 – Robotic Coin Toss
This project is developed within the framework of MRAC Workshop 2.1: Team Collaborative Workflow and Modular System Development. The aim of the workshop is to learn, internalize, and apply collaborative software development practices using Git and GitHub while building a modular robotic system. The assigned task of this group is the design and implementation of a robotic coin toss using a robotic arm and a standard 2-euro coin, with a focus on system engineering, documentation, and reproducibility.

## Overview
Although a coin toss is a simple human action, translating it into a robotic task reveals a complex system involving mechanics, kinematics, control logic, sensing, and repeatability. The project starts with an analysis of the human coin-toss motion, where the coin is balanced on the index finger at a slight inclination. The rotational motion is generated by elastic energy stored in the thumb and finger muscles, which is released to create vertical lift, forward impulse, and rotation. To maintain a mostly vertical trajectory, the release plane is subtly angled toward the body. Based on this analysis, several mechanical abstractions were explored, such as piston-based impulse systems and motor-driven ramp mechanisms. The project ultimately focuses on executing the task directly with a robotic arm, aligning with the workshop’s emphasis on robotic control, modular system design, and integration. A central question of the project is whether the system should prioritize randomness, as in a traditional coin toss, or controlled repeatability, which is intrinsic to robotic systems.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure that you fulfill the following criteria to replicate this project.
* Ubuntu LTS 20.04 <
* Python 3.7 <
* Docker

### Depencies
The project's dependencies include:
* Numpy - for numerical and matrix operations
* OpenCV - for image processing and visual analysis
* ROS - for robot control, communication, and system integration

The dependencies are satisfied using the following sources:
```bash
# ROS Noetic and core dependencies
wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qboticslabs/ros_install_noetic/master/ros_install_noetic.sh && chmod +x ./ros_install_noetic.sh && ./ros_install_noetic.sh
# install numpy
pip3 install numpy setuptools

## Installing

### A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd ../
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
source ./devel/setup.bash

## Deployment

### Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

Run the application with .docker/run_user_nvidia.sh

Ensure that you are running the indicate command sudo chmod -R <user_name> \dev_ws for permitions

Run terminator

## Demo

### Here is what the project can do and what are the results. The project demonstrates a robotic execution of a coin toss with controlled motion and analyzable outcomes. The project can be launched with the following command:

roslaunch package_name package_name.launch
This opens up rviz and shows the robot moving around during the coin-toss sequence.
