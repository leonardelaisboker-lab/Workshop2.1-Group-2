MRAC01 (25/26): Workshop 2.1 – Robotic Coin Toss

This project is developed within the framework of MRAC Workshop 2.1: Team Collaborative Workflow and Modular System Development.
The main objective of the workshop is to learn, internalize, and apply professional collaborative workflows using Git and GitHub while developing a modular robotic system in a standardized software environment.

The technical task assigned to our group is the design and implementation of a robotic coin toss using a robotic arm and a standard 2-euro coin. The project intentionally balances practical experimentation with system engineering, documentation, and collaborative development practices.

Overview

Although a coin toss is a simple and intuitive human action, translating it into a robotic process reveals a complex interaction of mechanics, kinematics, control logic, sensing, and repeatability. This project treats the coin toss as a system-level problem rather than a single mechanical action.

As a first step, the human coin-toss motion was analyzed. We observed that the coin is typically balanced on the index finger at a slight inclination rather than on a perfectly horizontal plane. The rotational motion of the coin is generated by elastic energy stored in the muscles and tendons of the thumb and index finger. When this elastic tension is released, the coin receives a combination of vertical lift, forward impulse, and rotational motion. To maintain a largely vertical trajectory and avoid excessive horizontal displacement, the release plane is subtly angled toward the body.

Based on this analysis, several mechanical and robotic abstractions of the coin toss were explored. These included piston-based impulse systems that strike the coin edge to induce rotation, as well as motor-driven solutions that guide the coin along a ramp. While these approaches provide high repeatability, they reduce the expressive and analytical potential of the task.

For this reason, the project focuses on executing the coin toss directly using a robotic arm, in alignment with the workshop’s emphasis on robotic control, modular system design, and integration. This decision introduces key design questions: whether the goal is to reproduce randomness or controlled repeatability, whether the system should emulate human motion or exploit robotic precision, and how sensing and feedback can be used to analyze and influence the outcome of the toss.

By framing the coin toss as a robotic experiment, the project explores how sensor data, controlled motion parameters, and potential learning-based approaches can transform a trivial action into a structured, analyzable system.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

To replicate this project, the following system requirements must be met:

Ubuntu LTS 20.04 or newer

Python 3.7 or newer

Docker

Dependencies

The project relies on the following core dependencies:

NumPy for numerical and matrix operations

OpenCV for image processing and visual analysis

ROS (Robot Operating System) for robot control, communication, and system integration

The dependencies can be installed using the following commands:

# ROS Noetic and core dependencies
wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qboticslabs/ros_install_noetic/master/ros_install_noetic.sh && chmod +x ./ros_install_noetic.sh && ./ros_install_noetic.sh

# Python dependencies
pip3 install numpy setuptools

Installing

To set up the development environment, run the following commands:

cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd ../
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
source ./devel/setup.bash

Deployment

For deployment on a live system, the following steps are required:

Run the application using .docker/run_user_nvidia.sh

Ensure correct permissions with sudo chmod -R <user_name> \dev_ws

Use terminator to manage multiple terminals during execution

Demo

The project demonstrates a robotic execution of a coin toss, focusing on controlled motion, repeatability, and analysis of the resulting coin behavior.

The system can be launched using:

roslaunch package_name package_name.launch


This command opens rviz and visualizes the robotic motion during the coin-toss sequence.
