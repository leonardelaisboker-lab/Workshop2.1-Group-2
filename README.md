## MRAC01 (25/26): Workshop 2.1 – Robotic Coin Toss
This project is developed within the framework of **MRAC Workshop 2.1: Team Collaborative Workflow and Modular System Development**.  
The primary objective of the workshop is to learn, internalize, and apply professional collaborative workflows using Git and GitHub while developing a small-scale robotic system.

The technical task assigned to our group is the design and implementation of a **robotic coin toss** using a robotic arm and a standard **2-euro coin**. The project focuses not only on the physical execution of the task but also on system engineering, modular development, and structured collaboration.

## Overview
At first glance, a coin toss is a simple human action. However, when translated into a robotic task, it becomes a complex system involving mechanics, kinematics, control, sensing, and repeatability.

The project begins with an analysis of the **human coin-toss motion**. We observed that the coin is balanced on the index finger at a slight inclination rather than a perfectly horizontal plane. The rotational motion of the coin is generated by elastic energy stored in the thumb and finger muscles. Upon release, this energy produces a combination of vertical lift, forward impulse, and rotation. To maintain a mostly vertical trajectory and avoid excessive horizontal displacement, the release plane is subtly angled toward the body.

Based on this analysis, several mechanical and robotic solutions were explored, including piston-based impulse systems and motor-driven ramp mechanisms. While these solutions provide high repeatability, the project ultimately focuses on executing the task directly with a **robotic arm**, in alignment with the workshop’s emphasis on robotic control and system integration.

A central design question of the project is whether the goal of the system should be **randomness** (as in a traditional coin toss) or **repeatability and control**, which are intrinsic strengths of robotic systems. This leads to further questions regarding sensing, feedback, and potential learning-based approaches to analyze and influence the outcome of the toss.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you fulfill the following criteria to replicate this project.
* Ubuntu LTS 20.04 <
* Python 3.7 <
* Docker

### Depencies
The project's dependencies include:
* Numpy – for numerical and matrix operations
* OpenCV – for image processing and visual analysis
* ROS – for robot control, communication, and system integration

The dependencies are satisfied using the following sources:

```bash
# ROS Noetic and core dependencies
wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qboticslabs/ros_install_noetic/master/ros_install_noetic.sh && chmod +x ./ros_install_noetic.sh && ./ros_install_noetic.sh
# install numpy
pip3 install numpy setuptools
Installing
A step-by-step series of commands to set up the development environment:

bash
Code kopieren
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd ../
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
source ./devel/setup.bash
Deployment
Additional notes on deploying the project on a live system:

Run the application with .docker/run_user_nvidia.sh

Ensure correct permissions using sudo chmod -R <user_name> \dev_ws

Run terminator for multi-terminal workflows

Demo
The project demonstrates a robotic execution of a coin toss, focusing on controlled motion, repeatability, and analysis of outcomes.

The project can be launched with the following command:

roslaunch package_name package_name.launch

This opens rviz and visualizes the robot motion during the coin-toss sequence.
