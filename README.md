## MRAC01 (25/26): Workshop 2.1 – Robotic Coin Toss
This project is developed within the framework of MRAC Workshop 2.1: Team Collaborative Workflow and Modular System Development. The aim of the workshop is to learn, internalize, and apply collaborative software development practices using Git and GitHub while building a modular robotic system. The assigned task of this group is the design and implementation of a robotic coin toss using a robotic arm and a standard 2-euro coin, with a focus on system engineering, documentation, and reproducibility.

## Overview
Although a coin toss is a simple human action, translating it into a robotic task reveals a complex system involving mechanics, kinematics, control logic, sensing, and repeatability. The project starts with an analysis of the human coin-toss motion, where the coin is balanced on the index finger at a slight inclination. The rotational motion is generated by elastic energy stored in the thumb and finger muscles, which is released to create vertical lift, forward impulse, and rotation. To maintain a mostly vertical trajectory, the release plane is subtly angled toward the body. Based on this analysis, several mechanical abstractions were explored, such as piston-based impulse systems and motor-driven ramp mechanisms. The project ultimately focuses on executing the task directly with a robotic arm, aligning with the workshop’s emphasis on robotic control, modular system design, and integration. A central question of the project is whether the system should prioritize randomness, as in a traditional coin toss, or controlled repeatability, which is intrinsic to robotic systems.

## Market Analysis and Use Cases

Although the robotic coin toss originates from an experimental and academic context, the underlying system combines precise robotics, sensing, vision-based analysis, and repeatable motion control. These characteristics enable several potential applications beyond the laboratory environment. The following use cases are ordered according to their estimated monetary viability.

### 1. Live Event & Sports Entertainment (High Monetary Potential)

A robotic coin toss system can be integrated into **sports events**, such as football matches, e-sports tournaments, or televised competitions, where coin tosses are traditionally used to decide kickoff, side selection, or turn order.

By replacing a human-performed toss with a robotic system, the process gains:
- Transparency and perceived fairness
- Visual spectacle and technological appeal
- Integration with broadcast graphics and live data visualization

The system could be sponsored, branded, or customized for major events, creating direct revenue streams through licensing, sponsorship deals, and event rentals. Due to the large audience reach and commercial nature of sports events, this represents the **highest monetization potential**.

---

### 2. Interactive Exhibition & Trade Fair Installation (Medium–High Monetary Potential)

The robotic coin toss can function as an **interactive installation** at trade fairs, technology expos, or corporate showcases. Visitors could trigger the coin toss, observe the motion analysis in real time, and interact with visualized data such as trajectories, rotation speed, or probability distributions.

This use case is attractive for:
- Technology companies showcasing robotics, AI, or sensing systems
- Universities and research institutions presenting applied research
- Brand activations focused on innovation and interaction

Revenue potential arises through **custom installations, short-term rentals, and commissioned builds**, placing this use case in the medium-to-high monetary range.

---

### 3. Artistic and Cultural Installations (Medium Monetary Potential)

In an artistic context, the robotic coin toss can be interpreted as a commentary on **chance, determinism, and control**. By visualizing trajectories, biases, and outcomes, the system can question the notion of randomness in both human and machine decision-making.

Such installations could be displayed in:
- Museums
- Galleries
- Media art festivals

While direct monetization is typically lower than commercial events, funding can be obtained through **grants, cultural institutions, and commissioned artworks**, resulting in moderate monetary viability.

---

### 4. Research, Education, and Demonstration Platforms (Low–Medium Monetary Potential)

The system can be used as a **teaching and research platform** for robotics, computer vision, control systems, and experimental design. It provides a tangible example of how simple actions become complex when formalized and automated.

Potential users include:
- Universities and research labs
- Robotics courses and workshops
- Educational demonstrations

Monetization is mainly indirect, through educational funding, institutional budgets, or curriculum integration. While valuable academically, this use case has **lower direct revenue potential**.

---

### 5. Public Interaction & Urban Installations (Low Monetary Potential)

As a public-facing installation in urban spaces or science centers, the robotic coin toss could serve as an engaging interactive object. However, such installations typically prioritize accessibility and education over profit.

Funding would likely depend on:
- Public grants
- Municipal programs
- Non-profit initiatives

As a result, this use case ranks lowest in terms of direct monetary return.

---

### Summary of Monetization Potential

1. Live Sports & Event Entertainment — **High**
2. Trade Fairs & Interactive Exhibitions — **Medium–High**
3. Artistic & Cultural Installations — **Medium**
4. Research & Education Platforms — **Low–Medium**
5. Public & Urban Installations — **Low**




## Experimental Test Setup

The experimental setup consists of an industrial robotic system designed to perform a controlled and repeatable coin toss. The core element of the setup is a **UR10 robotic arm**, equipped with a **flat plate end-effector**. Instead of grasping the coin during the toss, the end-effector generates an impulse from below, transferring linear momentum and inducing rotational motion in the coin.

The coin is always initialized at a fixed **zero position**, ensuring consistent initial conditions across trials. After each toss, the coin is returned to this reference position using a **suction cup mechanism** mounted on the robotic arm. This guarantees repeatability and allows sequential experiments without manual intervention.

To synchronize the physical interaction with the control logic, the system relies on **digital I/O signals**. These signals are triggered during the pickup and release phases of the coin, enabling precise timing control and state tracking within the robotic program.

To analyze the motion and trajectory of the coin, the setup incorporates **two camera systems**:

1. **Global Cell Camera**  
   The first camera observes the entire robotic cell. The workspace is defined using **four ArUco markers**, which allow the camera to estimate its pose and track the relative position of the robot and coin within a calibrated coordinate system. This camera provides spatial context and supports system-level motion analysis.

2. **Trajectory Analysis Camera**  
   The second camera is positioned laterally relative to the coin’s motion. It focuses directly on the coin during the toss. In the background, a **black-and-white striped pattern** is used to enhance visual contrast and facilitate trajectory extraction, rotation estimation, and motion tracking through image processing techniques.

Together, the robotic arm, suction-based reset mechanism, synchronized I/O control, and dual-camera vision system form a closed experimental setup. This configuration enables controlled coin tossing, repeatable initialization, and detailed motion analysis, serving as a foundation for further investigation into trajectory behavior, repeatability, and potential learning-based optimization.
